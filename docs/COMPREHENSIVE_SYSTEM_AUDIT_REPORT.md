## üö® Critical Issues Found

### None Identified ‚úÖ
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- No data exposure risks
- No authentication bypasses
- No performance bottlenecks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority Issues

1. **Debug Code in Production**
   - Location: Multiple files contain debug panels
   - Impact: Potential information disclosure
   - Recommendation: Remove debug components from production builds

2. **TODO Items in Services**
   - Location: `src/services/invitationService.ts`
   - Impact: Incomplete functionality
   - Recommendation: Implement RPC functions for invitations

3. **Large Service Files**
   - Location: `src/services/teamService.ts` (628 lines)
   - Impact: Maintainability concerns
   - Recommendation: Split into smaller, focused modules

## üí° Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Remove Debug Components**: Strip debug panels from production
2. **Implement RPC Functions**: Complete invitation service implementation
3. **Add Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error boundary coverage

### Short-term Improvements (Medium Priority)
